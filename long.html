                    <h1>Long Exposure</h1>
                    <b>Nov 01, 2017</b><b>views : 3,487,497</b>
                    <p>Night photography can be much more rewarding than photography during the day.
                        Because everything looks different at night, you don’t need to go somewhere exotic to get great pictures. 
                        Bridges, attractions, and buildings are usually brightly lit at night, and places that might seem rather pedestrian during the day – can make stellar photography subjects at night.
                        Further, you can take your time when photographing at night, more so than during the day. 
                        There are generally less people out, and you don’t have to worry about the light changing.
                        The main challenge when photographing at night is getting a proper exposure.
                        During the day, you can just walk around and hand hold your camera without worrying about camera shake.
                        In addition, because of the amount of available light during the day, you don’t need to worry about shooting at a high ISO and the resulting digital noise. At night, however, hand holding is generally not an option and digital noise can be a major problem.
                        The principles of exposure work the same way at night as during the day – you will just need a lot more time to allow light into your camera. It goes without saying that you will need a tripod to stabilize your camera, and a remote shutter release to keep from moving anything during the exposure. But with these changes made, you can get out and explore the night with your camera. 
                        When you do, here are some tips to keep in mind to help you maximize the experience.</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light 
                    or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically 
                    by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film
